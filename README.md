In this repo, all about Machine Learning and I covered both Supervised and Unsupervised Learning Techniques with Practical Implementation. Everything from scratch and I solved a lot of different problems with different Machine Learning techniques either related to Healthcare, E-commerce, Sports, or Daily Business Issues.

The Algorithms that are covered in this repository are:

Supervised Machine Learning

      1.1 Linear Regression
      1.2 Logistic Regression
      1.3 k-Nearest Neighbours(KNN)
      1.4 Support Vector Machine(SVM)
      1.5 Decision Trees
      1.6 Random Forests
      1.7 Boosted Trees
      1.8 Naive Bayes and NLP
